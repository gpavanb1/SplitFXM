1D [Finite-Difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method) or [Finite-Volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method) using asymmetric stencils with [adaptive mesh refinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_mesh_refinement) and steady-state solver using Newton and [Split-Newton](https://github.com/gpavanb1/SplitNewton) approach

## What does 'split' mean?

The system is divided into multiple segments, and for ease of communication, letâ€™s refer to the first segment of variables as "outer" and the remaining as "inner".

* Holding the outer variables fixed, Newton iteration is performed recursively for the inner variables, using the sub-Jacobian associated with them, until convergence is reached.

* One Newton step is then performed for the outer variables, while the inner variables are kept fixed, using the sub-Jacobian for the outer subsystem.

* This process is repeated, alternating between solving the inner and outer subsystems, until the convergence criterion for the entire system (similar to standard Newton) is met.

Consider a system of 5 variables, with the split locations at indices [1, 4]. This results in the following segments:

  * `a1` (variables from 0 to 1)
  * `a2 a3 a4` (variables from 1 to 4)
  * `a5` (variable at index 4)

1. First, the innermost segment `a5` is solved recursively using Newton's method while holding the variables `a1` and `a2 a3 a4`) fixed. This step is repeated until the convergence criterion for `a5` is met.

2. Next, one Newton step is taken for the segment `a2 a3 a4`, with `a5` held fixed. This step is followed by solving `a5` again till convergence.

3. This alternating process repeats: solving for `a5` until convergence, then one step for `a2 a3 a4`, and so on, until all subsystems converge.

Finally, one Newton step is performed for `a1`, with the other segments fixed. This completes one cycle of the split Newton process.

## Why SplitFXM?

The combination of adaptive mesh refinement+multiple boundary conditions+various finite-difference/finite-volume schemes in 1D is crucial for accurately capturing steep gradients and complex phenomena in various physical systems. A [SplitNewton](http://github.com/gpavanb1/SplitNewton) solver further increases robustness by efficiently handling non-linearities and stiff reactions, ensuring convergence in challenging scenarios.

Some of the applications where challenging 1D problems exist include:

- **Compressible Flows**: Shock waves, boundary layers.
- **Flamelet Problems**: Premixed and non-premixed combustion.
- **Batteries**: Electrochemical reactions, solid-electrolyte interfaces. 
- **Phase Changes**: Solidification, melting fronts.
- **Heat Transfer**: Thermal gradients in thin layers.
- **Chemical Kinetics**: Reaction fronts, ignition processes.
- **Acoustics**: Wave propagation in media with varying density.
- **Plasma Physics**: Sheaths, boundary layers in plasma.
- **Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)**: Magnetic reconnection, shock structures.
