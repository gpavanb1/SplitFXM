1D [Finite-Difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method) or [Finite-Volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method) using asymmetric stencils with [adaptive mesh refinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_mesh_refinement) and steady-state solver using Newton and [Split-Newton](https://github.com/gpavanb1/SplitNewton) approach

## What does 'split' mean?

The system is divided into two and for ease of communication, let's refer to first set of variables as "outer" and the second as "inner".

* Holding the outer variables fixed, Newton iteration is performed till convergence using the sub-Jacobian

* One Newton step is performed for the outer variables with inner held fixed (using its sub-Jacobian)

* This process is repeated till convergence criterion is met for the full system (same as in Newton)

## How to install and execute?

Just run 
```
pip install splitfxm
```

There is an [examples](https://github.com/gpavanb1/SplitFXM/models) folder that contains a test model - [Advection-Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection%E2%80%93diffusion_equation)

You can define your own equations by simply creating a derived class from `Model` and adding to the `_equations` using existing or custom equations!

A basic driver program is as follows
```
from splitfxm.domain import Domain
from splitfxm.simulation import Simulation
from splitfxm.schemes import default_scheme
from splitfxm.visualize import draw

# Define the problem
method = 'FDM'
m = AdvectionDiffusion(c=0.2, nu=0.001, method=method)
d = Domain.from_size(20, 1, 1, ["u", "v", "w"]) # nx, nb_left, nb_right, variables
ics = {"u": "gaussian", "v": "rarefaction"}
bcs = {
    "u": {
        "left": "periodic",
        "right": "periodic"
    },
    "v": {
        "left": {"dirichlet": 3},
        "right": {"dirichlet": 4}
    },
    "w": {
        "left": {"dirichlet": 2},
        "right": "periodic"
    }
}
s = Simulation(d, m, ics, bcs, default_scheme(method))


# Advance in time or to steady state
s.evolve(dt=0.1)
bounds = [[-1., -2., 0.], [5., 4., 3.]]
iter = s.steady_state(split=True, split_loc=1, bounds=bounds)

# Visualize
draw(d, "label")
```

## Run benchmark
There is a benchmark that is included, which compares the time it takes to generate both a sparse and dense Jacobian. The results are as follows:

For N=250, 

| Method    | Time       | 
|-----------|------------|
| Dense   |    20 seconds |
| Sparse |  ~0.6 seconds  |

The benchmark can be executed from the parent folder using the command

`python -m pytest -s benchmark`

## How to run tests?

To run the tests, execute the following command from the parent folder:
```
python -m pytest tests
```

You can use the `-s` flag to show `print` outputs of the tests

## How to get coverage?

To get coverage, execute the following command from the parent folder:
```
python -m pytest --cov=splitfxm --cov-report <option> tests
```

The `option` can be related to showing covered/missed lines or specifying the output format of the report. For example, to get a line-by-line report, use the following command:
```
python -m pytest --cov=splitfxm --cov-report term-missing tests
```
