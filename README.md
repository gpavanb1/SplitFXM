1D [Finite-Difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method) or [Finite-Volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method) using asymmetric stencils with [adaptive mesh refinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_mesh_refinement) and steady-state solver using Newton and [Split-Newton](https://github.com/gpavanb1/SplitNewton) approach

## What does 'split' mean?

The system is divided into multiple segments, and for ease of communication, letâ€™s refer to the first segment of variables as "outer" and the remaining as "inner".

* Holding the outer variables fixed, Newton iteration is performed recursively for the inner variables, using the sub-Jacobian associated with them, until convergence is reached.

* One Newton step is then performed for the outer variables, while the inner variables are kept fixed, using the sub-Jacobian for the outer subsystem.

* This process is repeated, alternating between solving the inner and outer subsystems, until the convergence criterion for the entire system (similar to standard Newton) is met.

### Example:

Consider a system of 5 variables, with the split locations at indices [1, 4]. This results in the following segments:

  * `a1` (variables from 0 to 1)
  * `a2 a3 a4` (variables from 1 to 4)
  * `a5` (variable at index 4)

1. First, the innermost segment `a5` is solved recursively using Newton's method while holding the variables `a1` and `a2 a3 a4`) fixed. This step is repeated until the convergence criterion for `a5` is met.

2. Next, one Newton step is taken for the segment `a2 a3 a4`, with `a5` held fixed. This step is followed by solving `a5` again till convergence.

3. This alternating process repeats: solving for `a5` until convergence, then one step for `a2 a3 a4`, and so on, until all subsystems converge.

Finally, one Newton step is performed for `a1`, with the other segments fixed. This completes one cycle of the split Newton process.

## How to install and execute?

Just run 
```
pip install splitfxm
```

There is an [examples](https://github.com/gpavanb1/SplitFXM/tree/main/splitfxm/models) folder that contains a test model - [Advection-Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection%E2%80%93diffusion_equation)

You can define your own equations by simply creating a derived class from `Model` and adding to the `_equations` using existing or custom equations!

A basic driver program is as follows
```
from splitfxm.domain import Domain
from splitfxm.simulation import Simulation
from splitfxm.models.advection_diffusion import AdvectionDiffusion
from splitfxm.schemes import default_scheme
from splitfxm.visualize import draw
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the problem
method = 'FVM'
m = AdvectionDiffusion(c=0.2, nu=0.001, method=method)
# nx, nb_left, nb_right, variables
d = Domain.from_size(20, 1, 1, ["u", "v", "w"])
ics = {"u": "gaussian", "v": "rarefaction", "w": "tophat"}
bcs = {
    "u": {
        "left": "periodic",
        "right": "periodic"
    },
    "v": {
        "left": {"dirichlet": 3},
        "right": {"dirichlet": 4}
    },
    "w": {
        "left": {"dirichlet": 2},
        "right": "periodic"
    }
}
s = Simulation(d, m, ics, bcs, default_scheme(method))


# Advance in time or to steady state
s.evolve(t_diff=0.1)
bounds = [[-1., -2., -2.], [5., 4., 3.]]
iter = s.steady_state(split=True, split_locs=[1, 2], bounds=bounds)

# Visualize
draw(d, "label")
plt.show()
```

## How to build from source?

Since v0.4.0, SplitFXM utilizes Cython for accelerated computation. To build from source, you will need to install Cython and run the following command:
```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

## Run benchmark
There is a benchmark that is included, which compares the time it takes to generate both a sparse and dense Jacobian. The results are as follows:

For N=250, 

| Method    | Time       | 
|-----------|------------|
| Dense   |    45 seconds |
| Sparse |  ~0.6 seconds  |

The benchmark can be executed from the parent folder using the command

`python -m pytest -s benchmark`

## How to run tests?

To run the tests, execute the following command from the parent folder:
```
python -m pytest tests
```

You can use the `-s` flag to show `print` outputs of the tests

## How to get coverage?

To get coverage, execute the following command from the parent folder:
```
python -m pytest --cov=splitfxm --cov-report <option> tests
```

The `option` can be related to showing covered/missed lines or specifying the output format of the report. For example, to get a line-by-line report, use the following command:
```
python -m pytest --cov=splitfxm --cov-report term-missing tests
```
